The University of Iowa archaeological field school has begun a more detailed exploration of that site to answer questions raised about the stratigraphy and the occupational history of the site. In the summers of 2012 - 2014, we have explored part of Caldwell’s back-dirt and determined where intact archaeological deposits were not disturbed by the 1956 excavation. Field school students have learned to use a battery of modern techniques for excavation, recording, mapping and analysis for the exploration of the occupation surface at the top of the talus slope. While 2013 revealed a reasonably intact occupation horizon dating to the middle to late Late Woodland, excavation in 2014 indicated a more complex situation of disturbance in the underlying levels, but also some exciting finds of diagnostic ceramics and lithics. Mapping of rock fall and rodent burrows suggest an occupational hiatus. The lowest level of 2014 and deeper testing on the slope suggest the presence of an older occupation just 10 cm deeper, dating to early Late Woodland. Exposure of that level will be the goal of the 2015 field school excavations.\n\nJim Enloe is Professor of Anthropology and currently chair of the Department of Anthropology at The University of Iowa. He has degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of New Mexico.
